                <h3>My story</h3>
                <p>
                    Hairdressing as an occupation dates back thousands of years.
                     Ancient art drawings and paintings have been discovered depicting 
                     people working on another person's hair. Greek writers 
                     Aristophanes and Homer both mention hairdressing in their writings. 
                     In Africa, it was believed in some cultures that a person's spirit occupied 
                     his or her hair, giving hairdressers high status within these communities.
                     

                    

                    
                </p>

                <p>
                    The status of hairdressing encouraged many to develop their skills, 
                    and close relationships were built between hairdressers and their clients. 
                    Hours would be spent washing, combing, oiling, styling and ornamenting their hair.
                     Men would work specifically on men, and women on other women. Before a master hairdresser died, 
                     they would give their combs and tools to a chosen successor during a special ceremony.

                    Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting
            industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text
            ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type
            and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not
            only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,

                <p>
                    remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s
            with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages,
            and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus
            PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum
