                    A chef is a trained professional cook and tradesman who is 
                    proficient in all aspects of food preparation, often focusing on a particular cuisine.
                     The word "chef" is derived from the term chef de cuisine 
                     (French pronunciation: ​[ʃɛf.də.kɥi.zin]), the director or head of a kitchen. 
                     Chefs can receive formal training from an institution,
                      as well as by apprenticing with an experienced chef.

                     such as the sous-chef, who acts as the second-in-command in a kitchen, or 
                     the chef de partie, who handles a specific area of production, or 
                     “Television chef”, such as Alison Holst. The kitchen brigade system is a hierarchy
